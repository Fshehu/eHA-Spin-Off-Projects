      <p>We’re skeptical of full-week meal planners because that’s just not realistic for most
        people. Some of us spend evenings chauffeuring carloads of kids to soccer practice and
        play dates. Others cook just for two. Instead, in this new feature of the Cooking Light
        Fresh Food Fast series, we focused on creating 10 meal planners that make enjoying fresh
        food at any meal throughout the week more practical. Each planner includes one shopping
        list for three dinners and a mix of breakfasts, lunches, snacks, and desserts. Cooking three
        nights a week? One planner’s got you covered. If you’re a devoted weeknight cook, you
        can combine two of your favorite planners for six dinners and nearly a week’s worth of
        great meals.
        The shopping lists don’t include the basics: salt, pepper, oil, all-purpose flour, and cooking
        spray (we assume you have those) or optional ingredients. You can download printable
        versions of the planners at CookingLight.com/FFFShoppingLists.</p>
